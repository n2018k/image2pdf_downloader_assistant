pdf2image and benchmark are backup and benchmark script
to check output from cbog-vision model at anytime
the problem is that output response may depend on the model and I am concerned my scripts 
only work for one model

the good thing is I dont really care. All i want is for a URL to open from an image or
use the title to do a google search in case doi fails

I have added pdf download question, sorting successfull and unsuccessful image question
and a loop tasks for all images in my directory

and a quit task to stop the code at any time and analyze current image.
